Just a place to store my Emacs configuration plus other misc scripts.

Prerequisites for a fresh install:

* Consolas font (yes, can be installed in Linux too)
* For the theme to load correctly you need to launch Emacs twice
* Deadgrep requires rg

There are other third party dependencies, but those should leave the more important things working

i3 config notes:
* The monitor switch bound to Win+P  is tied to my specific needs to my current laptop, didn't try to make it generic.
* .xmodmap are limited to making CAPS act like Control
