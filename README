Just a place to store my emacs configuration.

Prerequisites for a fresh install:

* Consolas font (yes, can be installed in Linux too)
* Unless I make some changes to the way the settings are configured (all via customize/none via customize), there's a chance I need to launch Emacs twice

Config notes:
* Need to work on the RPI stuff
* The monitor switch bound to Win+P in the i3 config is tied to my specific needs to my current laptop, it is not generic.
* .xmodmap changes are the result of a broken trackpad, wouldn't need context menu if I had a right click :)
