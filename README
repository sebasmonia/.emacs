Just a place to store my emacs configuration.

Zenburn has a small change to highlight the region using black background-green letters. Otherwise is identical to the one in the official repository.

Config notes (useful for my future self):
* Whitespace mode made everything too slow under Windows, so it's commented out.
* Default fullscreen frames are great. But they always open in the main monitor, so also commented that setting. Win+Arrow and then <f-11> it is.
* Must update proxy settings, or remove them.
