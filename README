Just a place to store my emacs configuration.

Prerequisites for a fresh install:

* Hack font
* Unless I make some changes to the way the settings are configured (all via customize/none via customize), there's a chance I need to launch Emacs twice

Config notes:
* Whitespace mode made everything too slow under Windows, so it's commented out.
* Default fullscreen frames are great. But they always open in the main monitor, so also commented that setting. Win+Arrow and then <f-11> it is.
* Moving computer-specific configuration to an external script. More tidy, but I kind of like having everything in a single place.
* Need to work on the RPI stuff
